    "# In Python, the return statement is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller.\n",
    "# It plays a crucial role in functions as it allows them to compute a result and provide that result to the part of the program that called the function. The return statement can also be used without a value to indicate that a function has finished its execution.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Here are the key aspects of the return statement:\n",
    "# # Returning a Value:\n",
    "# A function can use return to send a specific value back to the caller.\n",
    "# This value can be of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, or even custom objects.\n",
    "# Example :\n",
    "def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "    result = x + y\n",

    "def calculate_statistics(numbers):\n",
    "    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n",

    "# In Python, variable scope refers to the region of the code where a particular variable can be accessed or modified.\n",

    "# A local variable is declared inside a function or a block of code and is only accessible within that specific function or block.\n",
    "# The local scope is created when a function is called and is destroyed when the function completes execution.\n",
    "# Local variables are independent of each other, even if they have the same name in different functions.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "def my_function():\n",

    "#\n",
    "# A global variable is declared outside any function or block of code and is accessible throughout the entire program.\n",
    "# Global variables retain their values across different function calls and are generally used for data that needs to be shared across various parts of the program.\n",
    "# Modifying the value of a global variable inside a function requires the use of the global keyword.\n",
    "# Example:\n",

    "def another_function():\n",

    "# Built-in (B): Python's built-in names (e.g., print, len).\n",
